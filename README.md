## Overview

puppet agent management

## Module Description

If applicable, this section should have a brief description of the technology
the module integrates with and what that integration enables. This section
should answer the questions: "What does this module *do*?" and "Why would I use
it?"

If your module has a range of functionality (installation, configuration,
management, etc.) this is the time to mention it.

## Setup

### What puppet affects

* A list of files, packages, services, or operations that the module will alter,
  impact, or execute on the system it's installed on.
* This is a great place to stick any warnings.
* Can be in list or paragraph form.

### Beginning with puppet

```
class { 'puppet::agent':
  puppetmaster       => 'demoserver',
  puppetmasterport   => '1234',
  puppetenv          => 'tstenv',
}
```

## Usage

### multiple agents

To be able to have multiple agents we can use a cronjobs:

```
puppet::agent::cron { 'puppet.systemadmin.es':
  masterport = '8140',
}
```

## Reference

Here, list the classes, types, providers, facts, etc contained in your module.
This section should include all of the under-the-hood workings of your module so
people know what the module is touching on their system but don't need to mess
with things. (We are working on automating this section!)


## Development

We are pushing to have acceptance testing in place, so any new feature should
have some tests to check both presence and absence of any feature

### TODO

* improve configuration options
